        <h2>Taj Mahal, Agra</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal lit. 'Crown of the Palace', is an ivory-white marble
          mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.
          It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658)
          to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the
          tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
          (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set
          in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.Construction
          of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on
          other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is
          believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated
          at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately
          70 billion rupees (about U.S. $1 billion).

          India Gate is one of many British monuments built by order of the Imperial War Graves Commission (later renamed Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The architect was Sir Edwin Lutyens, an Englishman who designed numerous other war memorials and was also the principal planner of New Delhi. The cornerstone was laid in 1921 by the duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria. Construction of the All-India War Memorial, as it was originally known, continued until 1931, the year of the formal dedication of New Delhi as the capital of India.

        <h2>Red Fort, Delhi</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Red Fort (Lal Qila) is a monument built in 1638 that
          rises 33 meters (108 ft) above Old Delhi.[1] It was built
          by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. The fort is located in what
          is now the centre of Delhi, India.[2] It is made of red stone
          and marble. It was built on the right bank of the Yamuna River.
          The Red Fort was originally referred to as "Qila-i-Mubarak"
          (the blessed fort), because it was the residence of the royal
          family. The layout of the Red Fort was organised to keep and
          integrate this site with the Salimgarh Fort. The planning and
          aesthetics of the Red Fort represent the high point in Mughal
          creativity which happened during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan.
          This Fort has had many additions after its construction by Emperor
          Shah Jahan. It is a World Heritage Site.[2] it is made out of red sandstone.
